# GCP Integrations

Boxalino Ecosystem is tightly coupled with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) components (BigQuery, DataFlow, DataStudio, etc).

This repository will provide code-snippets to assist certain steps within our system integration.
It is assumed you already have a GCP project and a billing account set for it.
